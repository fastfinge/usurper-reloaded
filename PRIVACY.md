# Privacy Policy

**Usurper Reborn** - Last updated: January 2026

## Overview

Usurper Reborn is free and open source software (GPL v2). We respect your privacy and collect minimal data only when you explicitly opt in.

## Telemetry (Opt-In Only)

During alpha testing, we offer **optional** anonymous telemetry to help improve game balance and fix bugs.

### How to Enable/Disable

- **Opt-in**: You are asked during character creation if you want to enable telemetry
- **Opt-out**: You can disable telemetry at any time through the game settings
- **Default**: Telemetry is **disabled by default**

### What We Collect (When Enabled)

If you opt in, we collect anonymous gameplay statistics:

| Data Type | Examples | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Session info | Session start/end, play duration | Understand engagement |
| Combat stats | Win/loss, damage dealt, dungeon floor | Balance combat difficulty |
| Progression | Level ups, achievements unlocked | Track game progression |
| Shop activity | Items purchased, gold spent | Balance economy |
| Technical info | Platform (Windows/Linux/macOS), game version | Bug fixing |

### What We DO NOT Collect

- Your real name or identity
- IP addresses (GeoIP processing is explicitly disabled)
- Location data
- Email addresses
- Any personally identifiable information
- Your character's name (only used locally)
- Chat or text input
- Files on your computer

### Anonymous Identifier

A random anonymous ID (UUID) is stored locally in `.telemetry_id` to track sessions from the same installation. This ID:
- Is randomly generated and not linked to your identity
- Can be deleted by removing the `.telemetry_id` file
- Is only used if you opt into telemetry

### Where Data Is Sent

Telemetry data is sent to [PostHog](https://posthog.com), an open source analytics platform, hosted in the United States. PostHog's privacy policy: https://posthog.com/privacy

### Data Retention

Analytics data is retained for the duration of the alpha/beta testing period to help with game development. After the game reaches stable release, historical telemetry data may be deleted.

## Auto-Update Feature

The game checks for updates by contacting GitHub's public API:
- `https://api.github.com/repos/binary-knight/usurper-reborn/releases/latest`

This check:
- Sends your game version and a standard User-Agent header
- Does not send any personal information
- Results are cached locally for 4 hours to minimize requests

## Local Data Storage

The game stores the following data locally on your computer:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Save files | Your game progress | `saves/` folder |
| Settings | Game preferences | `settings.json` |
| Debug logs | Troubleshooting (local only) | `logs/` folder |
| Version cache | Reduce update checks | `version_cache.json` |
| Telemetry ID | Anonymous session tracking | `.telemetry_id` |

All local data stays on your computer and is never uploaded unless you explicitly enable telemetry.

## BBS Door Mode

When running as a BBS door game:
- The game reads your BBS username from the drop file (DOOR32.SYS or DOOR.SYS)
- This name is used only for your in-game character
- Save files are stored in a BBS-specific folder to separate users
- Auto-update is disabled (sysops manage updates)

## Third-Party Services

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| GitHub | Update checks, releases | https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies |
| PostHog | Analytics (opt-in only) | https://posthog.com/privacy |
